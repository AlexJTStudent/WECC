## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(mainData)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

# Line plot for Temperature over Date
ggplot(mainData, aes(x = Date, y = Temperature)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Temperature over Time", x = "Date", y = "Temperature (F)") +
  theme_minimal()



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
