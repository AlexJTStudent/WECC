# WECC

I included 3 different methods to load the data

.qmd, which is a markdown file for r
.py a basic python file
.ipynb a jupyter notebook file

clone this repository to experiment with the data on your own

in the scraper folder I have a program that can collect data for whichever dates or times you need,
but the program will need api keys, both of which you should be able to get for free

the folder also contains the sample data from 2020-2021
